Part One: Key Principles (25 Points) Key principles provide foundation for understanding a discipline. Briefly, discuss two of the five following key principles and their role in microeconomics in not less than 250 words (double spaced in 12-point Times New Roman font). Be certain to address each of the components from the topic. Be certain your explanation includes content from the required readings, lecture notes, and digital media archive. 
1.) Total Physical Product and Marginal Physical Product Total   physical   product   is   the   amount   of   output   the   firm   obtains   in   total   from   a   given   quantity   of   inputs.   Marginal   revenue   product   is   the   increase   in   total   output   that   results   from   a   one-unit   increase   in   the   input   quantity. First, discuss the relationship between total physical product and marginal physical product. Then,   define marginal revenue product and discuss its relationship to marginal   physical   product.   Lastly,   give   one   example of each from a recent news article.
2.) Input Quantities The most desirable output quantity for the firm clearly depends on how costs change as output varies. First,   discuss the three types of   cost curves economists use   to   display   and   analyze   this   information.   Then,   discuss   the marginal product relationship. Lastly, give one example of how costs change as output varies for the firm   from a recent news article.
3.) Price, Output and Profit It is a common misperception that the firm selects a price and a quantity of output that   maximize   profit.   First,   discuss why this is a common misperception. Then, discuss the impact activities of other firms in the market   competing   for a share of   total   market demand   have on a   firm.   Lastly, give one   example of   the   firm   maximizing   its profit from a recent news article.
4.) The Firm Under Perfect Competition Industries differ dramatically in the number and size of their firms. Perfect competition is a market structure   in which firms are numerous and   small.   First,   discuss   the   conditions   for   perfect   competition.   Then,   discuss   the   perfectively   competitive   firm.   Next,   compare   the   perfectively   competitive   firm   to   monopoly   power.   Lastly,   give one example of the   perfectively   competitive   firms   and   one   example   of   monopoly   power   from   a   recent   news article.
5.)    Limiting Marketing Power: Regulation and Anti-Trust To protect the public interest   from   monopolies,   government   uses   anti-trust   policy   to   prevent   acquisition   of   monopoly   power.   In   addition,   some   industries   are   regulated   by   rules   that   constrain   firms’   pricing.   First,   discuss how the government uses anti-trust policy to prevent acquisition of monopoly power. Then, discuss   one industry that is regulated by rules that constrain its pricing. Lastly, give an   example of   each   from   a   recent   news article.
Part Two: Key Concepts (25 Points) Key    principles    develop    key concepts. Briefly, discuss two of the five following key concepts and their role in microeconomics. Each discussion should be no less than 150 words. Be certain to address each of the components from the topic. Be certain your explanation includes content from the required readings, lecture notes, and digital media archive. 
1.) Production, Inputs, and Cost: Building Blocks for Supply Analysis The firm can generally substitute one input for another. Whether or not it pays to substitute   depends   on the   relative costs of labor and machinery. First, describe the alternative types   of   input   proportions   available   to   the   firm. Then, describe the combination of inputs that represent the least   costly way   for   the   firm   to   produce   its   goods. Lastly, give one example of the firm’s substitutability from a recent news article.
2.) Production, Inputs, and Cost: Building Blocks for Supply Analysis Total   profit is   the   net earnings of   the   firm during a   period of   time. Marginal   profit is   the   addition   to   total   profit   resulting from one more unit of output. Total revenue is the total amount of   money   the   firm   receives   from   the   consumers   of   its   goods,   without   any   deduction   of   costs.   Marginal   revenue   is   the   addition   to   total   revenue   resulting from the addition of one unit to output. First, expand   on these   descriptions   to completely   describe   their impact on the firm. Then, describe fixed cost and the profit-maximizing price. Lastly, give one example   of the profit-maximizing firm from a recent news article.
3.) Output, Price, and Profit: The Importance of Marginal Analysis If the firm is losing money, in certain cases it will   be better off continuing   to   operate until   its   obligations to pay   the   non-variable   costs   expire.   First,   describe   what   happens   if   the   firm   stops   producing.   Be   certain   to   describe   what   happens to its costs that are non-variable. Then, describe in which circumstances will the firm do   better by shutting   down immediately and producing nothing. Lastly, give an example of each from a recent news article.
4.) Output, Price, and Profit: The Importance of Marginal Analysis When   a   perfectly   competitive   industry   is   in   long-run   equilibrium,   firms   maximize   profits   so   that   P =   MC.   First,   describe the relationship between the firm and the industry under perfect competition in the long-run. Then,   describe the   firm supply curve under per代 写Microeconomics Final Examination Fall 2024R

Lastly,      give      one      example      of      the      firm      under      perfect   competition in the long-run and one example of the industry under perfect competition in the long-run from   a recent news article.
5.) Limiting Market Power: Regulation and Anti-Trust The   concentration   of   an   industry   measures   the   share   of   the   total   sales   or   assets   of   the   industry   in   the   ownership   of   its   largest   firms.   First,   describe   an   industry   that   has   a   very   low   concentration   ratio.   Then,   describe   an   industry that has a very concentration ratio. Next, describe what occurs when   circumstances in the industry   are favorable for price collusion. Lastly, give one   example   of   the   Herfindahl-Hirschman from   a   recent   news   article.
Part Three: Formulas and Schedules (25 Points) Key principles and key concepts describe formulas and graphs. Briefly, discuss three of the four following formulas or schedules to discuss and their role in microeconomics. Be certain to include in your discussion how each is used as an analytic tool used by economists. Each discussion should be no less than 150 words. Be certain to address each of the components from the topic. Be certain your explanation includes content from the required readings, lecture notes, and digital media archive. 
1.) Production, Inputs, and Cost: Building Blocks for Supply Analysis 
First, use the following schedule to calculate the marginal physical product, the marginal revenue product and the average physical product. Then, discuss the optimal point for the perfectly competitive firm. Number of Carpenters Total Physical Product, Garages (per year) Marginal Physical Product, Garages Added (per carpenter) Marginal Revenue Product, Carpenters Added ($ per year) Average Physical Product, Garages (per carpenter) 0 0

Assumptions:                         Price   Per   Garage:    $15,000                         Cost   Per   Worker:    $50,000
2.) Production, Inputs, and Cost: Building Blocks for Supply Analysis First, use the following schedule to calculate the marginal revenue, the marginal cost, the total profit, and the marginal profit. Then, list the formula for total revenue and total cost. Lastly, discuss the condition under which the firm will earn a profit, incur a loss, the output that maximizes the perfectly competitive firm’s profit, and under which a firm is maximizing profit by minimizing loss. Quantity Total Revenue (TR) Marginal Revenue (MR) Total Cost (TC) Marginal Cost (MC) Total Profit  (TP) Marginal   Profit (MP) 0 $0.00 
$0.00 


10 $30.00 
$38.00

$87.00 


30 $90.00 
$45.50 


40 $120.00

$137.50 


60 $180.00 
$158.00 


70 $210.00 
$240.00 



3.) Output, Price, and Profit: The Importance of Marginal Analysis First, use the following schedule to calculate the total cost, the loss if the firm shuts down, and the loss if the firm does not shut-down. Then, identify in which case (i.e. Case A or Case B) the firm should shut-down and discuss the reasons why the firm should shut-down in one case but not the other. Finally, discuss the condition under which the firm will incur a loss and the output level at which the firm will continue to operate. 
Case A Case B Total Revenue (TR) $120,000 $150,000 Total Variable Cost (TVC) $100,000 $220,000 Short-run, Non-variable Cost $80,000 $80,000 Total Cost (TC) 

Loss if Firm Shuts Down (short-run, non-variable   cost) 

Loss if Firm does not Shut-Down 


4.) Taxation, Distribution of Income and Resource Allocation First, explain how society decides rationally on how much equality it wants relative to income distribution. Next, discuss the policies available to the government to distribute income and the impact such policies may have on the microeconomy. Then, explain how despite economists use of economic analysis to provide suggestions for responding    to economic problems (i.e. housing crisis, financial crisis, Recession) the economy still often confronts market’s short-comings that deeply impact consumers and producers. Lastly, using any graph of your choice from the textbook, graphically illustrate your explanation. 
Part Four: Models and Debate (25 Points) Key principles, key concepts, and formulas/graphs guide a researcher’s analytic analysis. First, answer question number one. Be certain to include in your discussion it is used as an analytic tool used by economists. Then, select two of the remaining questions and in no less than 250 words debate how it is used as an analytic tool in microeconomics used by economists. Be certain to address each of the components from the topic. Be certain your explanation includes content from the required readings, lecture notes, and digital media archive. 
1.) Output, Price, and Profit: The Importance of Marginal Analysis 
The following graph illustrates a firm’s profits in perfect competition. Using the graph describe how-to calculate the following: 
The firm’s profit per unit of output:
The firm’s total profit:

2.) Limiting Market Power: Regulation and Anti-Trust Predatory pricing threatens to keep competitors out of the market. It is a price that is so low that it will be profitable for the firm that adopts it only if a rival is driven out of the market. Debate why predatory pricing is an economic inefficiency in a perfectly competitive market. 
3.) Limiting Market Power: Regulation and Anti-Trust Government    regulates prices    to prevent prices from    being    so high    that    they    bring    monopoly    profits    to    the firm. Government regulates prices to set levels that are compensatory to enable firms to cover their costs. Many regulated industries are characterized by significant economies of large-scale production. Debate why economist favor setting price equal to marginal cost. 
4.)    Externalities, the Environment and Natural Resources Our very existence makes environmental problems inevitable. Environmental problems are not new. First, explain what is different about the attention we now give to these problems relative to an earlier period of time. Next, debate how our behavior, institutions, and evolution contributed to environmental problems.
